Plugins TODO:
=============
- Create dialog for add plugins
  - dialog has an add plugin button
    - opens up a open folder dialog
    - names the plugin after the folder
  - existing dialogs are displayed in a list
    - each item displays name of dialog, directory, and a button to remove the plugin
- Need to be able to communicate between rust backend and sidecar
  - rust needs to store plugin directories in some file and send to sidecar
  - sidecar needs to serve plugins from these directories
